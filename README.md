# in_vgm-libvgm
a new libvgm-based version of the in_vgm Winamp plugin

This is based on the version released by Valley Bell.

# Rationale

I'm mostly interested in updating the user interface elements of this plugin. It's not bad, it just could use a refresh and some modern touches from newer flavors of Windows.
